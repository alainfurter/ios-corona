# ios-corona
An example iOS app that showed the number of infected, hospitalized persons in Switzerland per canton during the corona crisis

This was an example ios app to demonstrate how to pull and visualize the corona data that was collected in online respositories by many voluntary helpers around the country during the corona epidemic. 

Target OS / devices: Apple iPhone devices.

User interface / flow in the app as follows:

<h4>1.) Choose the canton in Switzerland</h4>
<img src="/Screenshots/Cantons.png" alt="Cantons" width="200"/>

<h4>2.) The data is visualized in the app. Info: number of people infected, hospitalized, ventilated.</h4>
<img src="/Screenshots/DataViewer.png" alt="Corona data" width="200"/>
  
<h4>3.) Open the side menu in order to switch to another canton</h4>
